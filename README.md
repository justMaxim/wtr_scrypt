# wtr_scrypt

how to run

1. Download the latest release. 
2. Download some profile and edit it coresponding to your requirements(wtr/profiles/...).
3. Enter your login and password in file login.py(wtr/scrypt/login.py).
4. Run bashscrypt(wtr/scrypt/bashscrypt.sh) in the terminal like this: bashscrypt.sh 2016-09-01 2016-09-03 profile_usual_day.py
   you can also enter only one date like: bashscrypt.sh 2016-09-04 profile_day_off.py
5. All the data will be stored as private in your wtr profile.
  So you still need to confirm filled report: just open wtr and the week you filled(in our case week 35),
  check all the data and register your report(don't forget to do this for both by and pl versions).

I am not sure if this is more convinient for you but you can at least try.
